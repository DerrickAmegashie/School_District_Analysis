# School_District_Analysis
## Overview of School_District_Analysis
The project involved assisting Maria, a Chief Data Scientist for  City School District to analyze data from a variety of sources and format. Her role is to analyze all Standardized Test Data for analysis, reporting and developing a presentation about insights, trends and patterns. The insights will be used to inform discussions and strategic decisions at the school and district level. My task to help Maria analyze data on student funding and student standardized test scores (math  & reading) as well as the various school they attend. I was to also aggregate the data and show trends and school performances. These analysis will help the school board in making decisions regarding the schools budget and priorities. 

Once I completed the above task, there were some dishonesty; specifically in the reading and math grades for the Thomas High School. As a result, I was tasked to replace both the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs while ensuring the rest of the data remains intact. After completion of the analysis, I am to highlight how these changes affected the overall analysis.
